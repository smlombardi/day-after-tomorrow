# Day After Tomorrow

A port of the Sublime theme "Tomorrow" (Light) Theme, from the classic set of Tomorrow themes.

I modernized the original Atom port to pass 1.0 specs, and deepened some of the bright colors.

Development so far focused on HTML, SCSS, and JS

Font in the screenshot is Source Code Pro Medium (instead of Regular).  I find that for light themes most fonts are not strong enough.
